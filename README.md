# ist-dissertation-latex-template
Master dissertation Latex template for [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) (Portugal).
If you are a student in IST and you want to write your dissertation using Latex, this can be a good starting point.
This template tries to follow this school's specification that you can get here:
* [Dissertation guidelines](http://da.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/sites/33/guia-preparacao-dissertacao-13_14_2.pdf)

I cannot guarantee you that this template is 100% right.
I recommend that you talk to your advisors to check it first.
I am not responsible for something going wrong, if you choose to use this template.

Focus on your thesis and not on the template.

## Requirements:
* Latex: This will depend on your Operating System. You have to check how to install all Latex packages for your OS.
* Any text editor (I use [Atom](https://atom.io/))
* Latex plugins for your text editor (this is optional, but it will make your life easier).
I use the following ones for Atom:
  * [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex)
  * [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex)
  * [latexer](https://atom.io/packages/latexer)

## Usage
To use this template, you can simply fork this repo and start working on it.

If you don't want to fork, you can download a zip of the repo.

Once you have a copy of this repo, you can start creating sections, add a bibliography, etc.

### Create a new section
To create a new section, you first need to create a file in ```sections``` folder.
The easiest way to do this, is to create a copy of ```sections/new_section_template.tex``` file:
```
$ cp sections/new_section_template.tex sections/mysection.tex
```

In the new file, change the section's title and label.

Now you just need to include this new section in the main file.
Open ```dissertation.tex``` file and, below a comment ```% Sections```, include your section wherever it makes sense to you.
```latex
% Sections
...
\include{sections/mysection}
...
```

Now get some inspiration and write its content.

### Write the abstract
The abstract is located at ```sections/abstract.tex```.
Open that file in your favorite text editor and start writing your abstract and also defining the keywords.

### Write the acknowledgments
Along the way, some people helped you.
If you want to show them some love, this is the right place for it.
Open the file ```sections/acknowledgments.tex```and say thanks to everyone.

Also, it would be nice if you buy, at least, a beer to whoever supported you :)
(Including the one that provided you this awesome template)

### Add a new image
Image files go to ```images``` directory.
Place your files here and include them in wherever makes sense.

### Add bibliography
The bibliography is in a bib file located at ```bibliography/dissertation.bib```.
Put your bibliography there and cite it anywhere.

## Compile
You have two ways to create the final pdf:

### Using the text editor
It depends on the text editor you are using.
If you are using atom and the latex plugin, just press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>

### Using the provided scripts
If you have the complete Latex environment installed, you can run the ```toPDF.sh``` script to generate the PDF (```dissertation.pdf```):
```
$ sh toPDF.sh
```

To clean all the mess (files generated by the compilation process), you can run ```clean.sh``` script:
```
$ sh clean.sh
```
