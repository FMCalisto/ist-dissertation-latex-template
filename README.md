# ist-dissertation-latex-template
Master dissertation Latex template for Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (Portugal).
If you are a student in IST and you want to write your dissertation using Latex this can be a good starting point.
This template tries to follow this school's specification that you can get here:
* [Dissertation guidelines](http://da.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/sites/33/guia-preparacao-dissertacao-13_14_2.pdf)

I cannot garantee you that this template is 100% right. I recommend that you talk to your advisors to check it first.
I am not responsible if something goes wrong if you choose to use this template.

Focus on your thesis and not on the template.

## Requirements:
* Latex: This will depend on your Operating System. You have to check how to install all Latex packages for your OS.
* Any text editor (I use [Atom](https://atom.io/))
* Latex plugins for your text editor (This is optional but it will make your life easier).
I use the following ones for Atom:
  * [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex)
  * [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex)
  * [latexer](https://atom.io/packages/latexer)

## Compile:
To create the final pdf you have two ways to do it:

### Using the text editor
It depends on the text editor you are using. If you are using atom and the latex plugin you just to press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>

### Using the provided scripts
If you have the complete Latex environment installed you can run the ```toPDF.sh``` script to generate the PDF (```dissertation.pdf```):
```
$ sh toPDF.sh
```

To clean all the mess (files generated by the compilation process) you can run ```clean.sh``` script:
```
$ sh clean.sh
```
